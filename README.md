# DEPI Online Store ‚Äì SQL Project

## üìå Overview
This repository contains the SQL deliverables for the **DEPI Online Store Data Analysis Project**, part of the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)**.  
As the SQL team, our main responsibility is to prepare database queries and views that answer the business-critical questions requested by the Board of Directors.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Build clean and reusable **SQL Views** for each KPI required by stakeholders.  
- Use **MySQL (Workbench 8.40)** to aggregate and analyze e-commerce data.  
- Support further steps of the workflow:  
  - Power Query (data import & cleaning)  
  - Power Pivot (star schema modeling)  
  - Excel (visualization & storytelling)  

---

## üìÇ Scope of Work (SQL Team)
Our focus is on **Steps 1 & 2** of the workflow:
1. **Analyzing the data** in MySQL (sessions, orders, revenue, refunds, products, customers).  
2. **Building SQL Views** for each KPI required by stakeholders.  

The views will later be imported into Power Query and used for dashboards in Excel.

## üöÄ Workflow  
1. Each stakeholder has a dedicated folder under `/tasks`.  
   - Example: `/tasks/CEO`, `/tasks/CFO`, `/tasks/CMO`, `/tasks/COO`  
2. Inside each folder, there is **one `.sql` file** that contains all KPIs/queries for that stakeholder.  
   - Example: `ceo_kpis.sql`, `cfo_kpis.sql`  
3. Each member works on their own **branch**, then submits a Pull Request with updates to their stakeholder‚Äôs `.sql` file.  
4. Team Leader reviews and merges into the `main` branch.
